## Introduction to Monitoring
Monitoring tracks the state, health, behavior, and performance of your applications and IT environment.

Monitoring includes the following key activities
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Alerts
- Visualization
- Diagnostics and troubleshooting

Monitoring provides the following important benefits
- Performance and cost optimization
- Proactive management
- Reliability
- Capacity planning
- Security monitoring
- Compliance and goverance monitoring

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, and responding to monitoring data from cloud and on-premises environments.

The below image shows the high level architecture of Azure Monitor.

## Application Insights
Application Insights is an extension of Azure Monitor and provides Application Performance monitoring ("APM") features.
- Data collection and storage
- Data analysis and response
- Alerts, workbooks, and visualizations


### Features Overview
| Featured | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Live Metrics | Observe activity from deployed application in real time |
| Avialbility | Synthetic Transaction Monitoring , to probe overall availability and responsiveness over time |
| GitHub or Azure DevOps Integration | Create GitHub or Azure DevOps work items in context of Application insights data. |
| Usage | Understand which features are popular with users |
| Smart Detection | Automatic failure and Anamoly detection through proactive telemetry analysis. |
| Application Map | High level top-down view of the application architecture |
| Distributed Tracing | Search and visualize and end-to-end flow of a given execution or transaction. |

### What Application Insights monitors
- Request rates, response times, and failure rates
- Dependency rates, response times, and failure rates
- Page views and load performance
- Exceptions
- AJAX calls
- User session counts
- Performance counters
- Host diagnostics
- Diagnostic trace logs
- Custom events and metrics

### Discover log-based metrics
Application Insights log-based metrics let you analyze the health of monitored apps, create powerful dashboards, and configure alerts.
Two kinds of metrics
- **Log-based metrics**
- **Standard metrics** stored as pre-aggregated time series.

### Instrument an app for monitoring
Application Insights is enabled through either *Auto-Instrumentation (agent)* or by adding *Application Insights SDK* to application code.

- Auto-Instrumentation
    - All you have to do is enable and in some cases, configure the agent, which collects the telemetry automatically.

- Enabling via Application Insights SDKs
    Need to install Application Insights SDK in the following circumstances
    - require custom events and metrics
    - require control over the flow of telemetry
    - Auto-Instrumentation is not available

- Enable via OpenCensus
    OpenCensus is an open source, vendor-agnostic, single distribution of libraries to provide metrics collection and distributed tracing of services.

### Select an availability test
Can set up recurring tests to monitor availability and responsiveness.
Three types of availability tests
- **URL ping test(classic)**
- **Standard test(preview)**
- **Custom TrackAvailability test** 

### Troubleshoot app performance by using Application Map
- Each node on the map represents an application component or its dependencies; has an
    - Health KPI
    - Alert status
- 


## Azure Monitor Service
### Setting up Alerts
- Setting Static Alerts
- Setting Dynamic thresholds
    Azure Monitor uses Machine learning to check the historical behavior of metrics.

    - Sensitivity
        - High
        - Medium
        - Low

## Log Analytics Workspace
- Central solution for all logs.
    - kusto query language
    - marketplace solutions

- Query using Powershell
